# Project Context

This is a QMK firmware fork where we are building a CLI tool for editing structured JSON keyboard definition files.

- **Implementation:** `lib/python/qmk/cli/edit`
- **Tests:** `lib/python/qmk/tests`

## Skills

Load relevant skills before writing, editing, or reviewing code:

- **QMK skills** (`qmk-cli-development`, `qmk-coding-conventions`): Load when working in `lib/python/qmk/cli/` or `lib/python/qmk/tests/`.
- **Python skills** (`python-style`, `python-tests`): Load when working with `.py` files.

When QMK conventions and `python-style` guidelines conflict, QMK conventions take precedence.

## Python Environment

Run all Python commands using `.venv/bin/python` to ensure the correct dependencies and Python version are used.

## Current Date

When you need the current date, use the bash command: `date -I`
